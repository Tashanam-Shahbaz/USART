# USART

### Discription
A microcontroller/microprocessor-based application to operate a password-protected locker with machine-to-machine (M2M) communication incorporated in the design. Password is entered through a keypad and a digital display (LCD or seven-segment display) is used to show the current status of the locker. If the locker door is latched, password can be entered by the user to unlatch it. The password entered, by the user, is sent by the microcontroller (which we call the transmitter microcontroller) to another serially interfaced (UART) microcontroller (called the receiver microcontroller). At the receiver end, password entered is matched to the correct password of the respective locker.
